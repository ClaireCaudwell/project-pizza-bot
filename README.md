# Pizza Bot

The project was to practice javascript to create an interactive pizzabot and make it work inside the DOM. 

## The problem

1. We started by reading through the project and then doing the iteration 1, 2 3 and 4 which we found the easiest. 

2. Then we started to add the conditional statements. The first one where you are meant to create an if else statement; if the user inputs a pizza that is on the menu then that will be true and if not then it'll be false. 

The second if, else if and else statements felt understandable. 

3. Then we got really stuck on the functions. I think this was because we didn't really understand how they work and what arguments to write in the brackets. As well as how to call these and then use/store the information that was created when the function was run. After a bit of help and some googaling we understood better how we were meant to use these. We also created two big functions where all the other small functions were called based on user input and if it was true or false. 

4. Once we go the functions to work together we started to edit the prompts and alerts so we couls view the information in the DOM. We used the document.getElementById().innerhtml to connect both the javascript sections to the html. 

In terms of planning our time and working together, we tried to be methodical with the brief and the iterations. We tried to navigate and drive in intervals. If one if us didn√§t understand then we tried to explain it to, so we both understood. 

For the end result we managed to get the form functions and onsubmit attribute of the form work inline with the last two functions. This meant that when the user inputted information and submitted with the submit button it made the next form section appear. 

If we had more time it would be nice to make the first greeting sentance from the pizzabot to load with the page, but then you would need to interact with that statement in order to get up the first form section where it asks for you to input your username and input the username you want to order. Also it would be nice to add some animations so you could simulate the pizza bot acting more like a robot that is asking questions with the user can interact with. 

We had some help from various people, as this task was super hard. But even though we found it hard it feels like now that we understand more about variables, if else conditionals and functions.
